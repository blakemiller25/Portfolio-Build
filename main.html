        <h2>Point to Point OSPF Network</h2>
        <img src="Images/PTP OSPF.png" alt="Logical Topology OSPF" height="520" width="800">
        <p>This network topology is designed to implement a point-to-point OSPF routing configuration, enabling efficient communication between multiple connected devices. It consists of end-user devices, a centralized routing structure, and a server providing web and DNS services. The topology ensures seamless connectivity between different segments, allowing devices to communicate through a structured and organized network. By implementing OSPF, dynamic routing is enabled, allowing the network to adapt to changes and maintain efficient data transmission. With a well-defined structure, this setup supports reliable communication and efficient data exchange, making it an effective design for scalable networking solutions.</p>
        <img src="/Images/EIGRP Network.png" alt="Logical EIGRP Network" height="600" width="800">
        <p>This network topology is designed using the Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) to facilitate efficient and dynamic routing between multiple network segments. The topology consists of interconnected routers forming a redundant and fault-tolerant structure, ensuring optimized path selection and load balancing. Various end-user devices, including PCs, are distributed across different network segments, connected through switches to provide local connectivity. Additionally, an external connection to an ISP is present, allowing communication beyond the internal network. The highlighted redundant links in the core of the topology demonstrate EIGRPâ€™s ability to quickly adapt to link failures, ensuring continuous data flow. This setup is well-structured for scalable networking solutions, providing reliable connectivity and efficient routing updates.</p>
