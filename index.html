        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p><strong>Hello I am Blake Miller and I am an IT systems student at Truro NSCC campus.</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>I chose to enroll in the IT Systems course at NSCC because I wanted to build a strong foundation in information technology while keeping my education affordable. Coming straight out of high school, I felt that university tuition would be too expensive, and I wanted to make a practical and financially smart decision. NSCC offers a hands-on learning experience that aligns with my goals, allowing me to gain valuable skills and knowledge in IT systems without the financial burden of a university degree. This path will help me develop a solid understanding of the field and prepare me for future career opportunities.</li>
            <li>I've always been interested in how networks function and connect people, businesses, and systems across the world. As I progress through my IT Systems course at NSCC, I've developed a strong passion for networking and the critical role it plays in modern technology. I enjoy troubleshooting connectivity issues, configuring routers and switches, and ensuring that networks run smoothly and securely. The challenge of designing, implementing, and maintaining networks excites me, and I know that a career in networking will keep me engaged with constant learning and problem-solving.

                My goal is to become a network administrator or engineer, working with companies to build and maintain efficient and secure networks. I plan to continue expanding my knowledge by earning industry certifications such as Cisco’s CCNA and gaining hands-on experience through labs and real-world projects. Networking is a field that offers great career growth and opportunities, and I’m eager to develop my skills and contribute to the ever-evolving world of IT infrastructure.</li>
